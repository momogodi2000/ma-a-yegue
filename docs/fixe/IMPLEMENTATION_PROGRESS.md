# Ma'a yegue - Implementation Progress Report

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** In Progress - Phase 1 Complete

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks (2/10)

### 1. ✅ Terms & Conditions - Show Only Once on First Launch
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Created `lib/core/services/terms_service.dart` - Service to manage terms acceptance persistence
- Modified `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/views/splash_view.dart` - Added logic to check if terms were already accepted
- Modified `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/views/terms_and_conditions_view.dart` - Uses `TermsService` to store acceptance

**Implementation Details:**
- Terms acceptance is stored in `SharedPreferences` with versioning support
- Key: `terms_accepted`, `terms_version`, `terms_accepted_date`
- Current terms version: `1.0.0`
- When terms change in future, increment version to require re-acceptance
- Flow: If terms not accepted → Show terms page → After acceptance → Navigate to landing
- Flow: If terms already accepted → Skip terms page → Navigate to landing directly

**Testing:**
```bash
# First launch
Splash → Terms & Conditions (user must accept) → Landing

# Subsequent launches
Splash → Landing (terms skipped)
```

### 2. ✅ Firebase Authentication - Save All Users to Firestore
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Problem:**
- Google Sign-In, Facebook Sign-In, Email/Password authentication were NOT saving user data to Firestore
- Only Firebase Auth was being used, no user profile data was persisted
- No role assignment was happening

**Changes Made:**
File: `lib/features/authentication/data/datasources/auth_remote_datasource.dart`

**Fixed Methods:**
1. `signInWithGoogle()` - Now saves user to Firestore with role 'learner'
2. `signInWithFacebook()` - Now saves user to Firestore with role 'learner'
3. `signUpWithEmailAndPassword()` - Now creates Firestore document with role 'learner'
4. `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` - Now updates lastLoginAt in Firestore

**Implementation Details:**
Each authentication method now:
1. Authenticates with Firebase Auth
2. Creates/updates user document in Firestore collection `users`
3. Sets default role to `'learner'` for new registrations
4. Stores: uid, email, displayName, photoURL, role, authProvider, createdAt, lastLoginAt, isActive
5. Fetches complete user data from Firestore (including role) and returns it

**Firestore Structure:**
```json
{
  "users": {
    "{userId}": {
      "uid": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "displayName": "string",
      "photoURL": "string | null",
      "role": "learner | teacher | admin",
      "authProvider": "google | facebook | email",
      "createdAt": "Timestamp",
      "lastLoginAt": "Timestamp",
      "isActive": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Default Role Assignment:**
- ✅ All new registrations → Role: `learner` (apprenant)
- ✅ Only admin can create teachers or other admins (to be implemented in admin module)
- ✅ User data is properly fetched from Firestore after auth, ensuring role is available for routing

---

### 3. ✅ Guest User Module - Real Implementation with SQLite + Firebase Sync
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `GuestDashboardViewModel` to use `GuestContentService` for all data
- Modified `guest_dashboard_view.dart` to use real data from ViewModel instead of static objects
- Updated `demo_lessons_view.dart` to fetch lessons from SQLite + Firebase hybrid
- Modified `guest_explore_view.dart` to use supported languages and ViewModel
- All navigation updated from `Navigator.pushNamed` to `context.go()` (GoRouter)
- Added FutureBuilder to load lesson content dynamically
- Lessons now display real words/translations from database
- Added loading states and error handling
- CTAs for registration updated throughout

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/features/guest/presentation/views/guest_dashboard_view.dart`
- `lib/features/guest/presentation/views/demo_lessons_view.dart`
- `lib/features/guest/presentation/views/guest_explore_view.dart`

**Implementation Details:**
- Views now use `Consumer<GuestDashboardViewModel>` to access real data
- Demo lessons load from SQLite with fallback to static content if database empty
- Lesson content fetched dynamically via `viewModel.getLessonContent(lessonId)`
- Stats (words count, languages, learners) loaded from `contentStats` in ViewModel
- Hybrid data approach: SQLite first, Firebase overlay for public content

## 🔄 In Progress / Pending Tasks (6/10)

### 4. ✅ Rename App: "Ma’a yegue" → "Ma'a yegue"
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated `pubspec.yaml` description to include "Ma'a yegue"
- ✅ Updated `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Changed android:label to "Ma'a yegue"
- ✅ Updated `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/views/splash_view.dart` - Changed app name text
- ✅ Updated `lib/features/guest/presentation/views/guest_dashboard_view.dart` - Changed app name text
- ✅ Updated `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` - Changed appName to "Ma'a yegue"
- ✅ Updated `lib/l10n/app_fr.arb` - Changed appName to "Ma'a yegue"

**Files Modified:** 6 files

---

### 5. ✅ Default Admin Migration/Initialization
**Status:** COMPLETED

See `ADMIN_INITIALIZATION_GUIDE.md` for full documentation.

---

### 6. ✅ Role-Based Redirection After Login
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Implementation Verified:**
- ✅ `splash_view.dart` (lines 70-86) - Checks user role and redirects appropriately
- ✅ `router.dart` - `_getRoleBasedDashboard()` function maps roles to routes
- ✅ `auth_viewmodel.dart` - `navigateToRoleBasedDashboard()` method
- ✅ `user_role.dart` - `defaultDashboardRoute` property for each role
- ✅ Login views call `navigateToRoleBasedDashboard()` after successful authentication

**Routing Logic:**
- Admin → `/admin-dashboard`
- Teacher/Instructor → `/teacher-dashboard`
- Learner/Student → `/dashboard`
- Visitor → `/guest-dashboard`

**How It Works:**
1. After successful login, `authViewModel.navigateToRoleBasedDashboard()` is called
2. Role is fetched from Firestore user document
3. Router's `refreshListenable` triggers navigation update
4. User is redirected to role-appropriate dashboard

---

### 7. ⏳ Admin Dashboard - Real Firebase Integration
**Status:** PENDING - Major Work Required

**Requirements:**
- Audit all admin features/buttons
- Implement real-time Firebase communication for each feature
- Remove any non-functional UI elements or implement their backend logic
- Features to implement:
  - User management (CRUD)
  - Role assignment
  - Content moderation
  - Teacher approval/creation
  - Analytics dashboard
  - System health monitoring

**Files to Review:**
- `lib/features/dashboard/presentation/views/admin_dashboard_view.dart`
- `lib/features/dashboard/presentation/viewmodels/admin_dashboard_viewmodel.dart`
- All admin widgets

---

### 8. ✅ Dark Mode - Fix Toggle and Persistence
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added SharedPreferences persistence to `ThemeProvider`
- ✅ Added `initialize()` method to load saved theme preference
- ✅ Updated `setThemeMode()` and `toggleTheme()` to persist changes
- ✅ Modified `main.dart` to initialize theme on app start
- ✅ Added Dark Mode toggle to Profile page with icon
- ✅ Theme applies immediately to all pages via MaterialApp themeMode

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/shared/providers/theme_provider.dart` - Added persistence logic
- `lib/main.dart` - Initialize theme from SharedPreferences, updated title to "Ma'a yegue"
- `lib/features/profile/presentation/views/profile_view.dart` - Added Dark Mode toggle switch

**How It Works:**
1. Theme preference saved to SharedPreferences with key `theme_mode`
2. On app start, `ThemeProvider.initialize()` loads saved preference
3. User toggles dark mode in Profile → Settings
4. Change persists across app restarts
5. All pages automatically respect theme via `MaterialApp.themeMode`

---

### 9. ⏳ Language Switching (i18n) - Apply Immediately
**Status:** PENDING

**Requirements:**
- When user changes language in settings/profile, ALL app strings must update immediately
- Support French ↔ English
- No app restart required
- Use existing l10n infrastructure

**Files to Fix:**
- Language selector in settings/profile
- Ensure all widgets use AppLocalizations
- Trigger rebuild when language changes

---

### 10. ⏳ Remove Non-Functional Buttons/Features
**Status:** PENDING

**Requirements:**
- Audit entire app for buttons that don't do anything
- Either implement their functionality OR remove them cleanly
- Document any removed features and reasoning

**Approach:**
- Go through each screen systematically
- Test every button/action
- Fix or remove

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Notes

### Issues Identified:
1. **Package Compatibility**: Some packages disabled (record, sign_in_with_apple, speech_to_text)
2. **Commented Code**: Significant amount of commented-out code exists
3. **Static Data**: Many guest pages use placeholder data instead of real implementation

### Recommendations:
1. Continue systematic approach - finish one module before moving to next
2. Write integration tests for each completed module
3. Document Firebase security rules needed for production
4. Create admin documentation/user guide
5. Set up proper error logging and monitoring
