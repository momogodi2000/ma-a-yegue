   flutter run
   ```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If app doesn't launch:

1. **Check USB connection:**
   ```bash
   adb devices
   # Should show your device with "device" status, not "unauthorized"
   ```

2. **Enable USB debugging on device:**
   - Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build number" 7 times
   - Settings → Developer Options → Enable USB Debugging

3. **Clean and rebuild:**
