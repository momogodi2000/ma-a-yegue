- [ ] Secure Firebase rules (restrict access by user role)
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data in SQLite
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for public forms
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Lazy loading for large lists
- [ ] Image caching (already added with cached_network_image)
- [ ] Database indexing for frequent queries
- [ ] Pagination for content lists
- [ ] Background sync for Firebase
- [ ] Optimize app size (remove unused dependencies)

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Clean Architecture already implemented (features, core, shared)
- ‚úÖ Provider pattern for state management
- ‚úÖ Error handling in main modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive inline documentation
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Extract magic numbers/strings to constants
- [ ] Implement logging service

## üì± Next Steps to Run & Test

1. **Test on Android:**
