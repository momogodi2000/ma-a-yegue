## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: App still won't launch

**Check 1: Device Connection**
```bash
adb devices
# Should show: <device-id>  device
# If shows "unauthorized", check phone for USB debugging prompt
```

**Check 2: USB Debugging Enabled**
- Settings → About Phone
- Tap "Build number" 7 times (enables Developer Options)
- Settings → Developer Options
- Enable "USB Debugging"
- Enable "Install via USB"

**Check 3: Clean Build**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Check 4: Logcat Output**
```bash
# Run app and immediately check logs
flutter run -v

# In another terminal:
adb logcat | findstr "flutter"
```

### Issue: Import errors after name change

**Already Fixed!** All 617+ files updated. If you see any remaining:
```bash
# Search for remaining old imports
findstr /s /i "package:mayegue" .\lib\*.dart

# Replace manually if found
```

### Issue: Build failures

**Gradle Issues:**
```bash
cd android
.\gradlew clean
